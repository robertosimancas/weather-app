# weather-app

Get weather conditions of any city using Python. 

To do this, I used the beautifulsoup4 library. This library is used for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. 

The code then asks the user for the name of a city and scrapes the weather updates of it by searching it on Google. It provides current information about location, time, info, and weather.
